# Nock Benchmarks

Benchmark code evaluations for comparing Nock evaluation performance.

Benchmarks should include:

- `.nock` files containing cells of `[subject formula]`
- `.noun` jamfiles of the Nock code.
- `.hoon` source files for the Nock code (optional).

We supply `tiny.nock` as a compiled version of `/lib/tiny` from Hoon 139K.  This may form an appropriate subject for some benchmarks.
